  <p align="center">
    Aureus is a responsive and functional HTML5 client built for Club Penguin. We are currently in the early development phases and plan to have a public access period sometime in 2023. This is a part time project with only one developer contributing to it at any given time. There may be progress in the development with little to no public updates immediately pushed.
